As our Western culture has lost connection with the importance of holistic support, especially during intense periods of transition, more formalized roles have formed to fill these needs. I've heard it said that the generation that birthed midwifery and birth doulas are now reaching out for a different experience facing death. In our death-phobic, physical body-focused culture, death doulas are now emerging as a invaluable part of end of life care, providing the spiritual, emotional, mental and practical support that is fundamental to the transition of dying. This role nicely complements the important role of hospice and traditional end of life care. Due to constraints of insurance and the medical system, hospice services are restricted in what services can be preformed, how much time can be spent and ways of engagement.

I'm delighted to have been powerfully drawn to end of life care after profound experiences with death in my personal life and to watch these different parts of me integrate into this role that suits me so well. I've been honored to provide respite care, vigiling, active-dying support, end of life paperwork assistance, reiki, and dried flower arrangements. I'm regularly told I provide a gentle, grounding, comforting presence that feels like family. I seem to especially resonate with dementia patients and people who are extra sensitive to \"outsiders\". As I've learned to do for myself, I show up as a steadfast companion for whatever arises and have learned to never underestimate the power of good company. </p>\n      <p>Education: BSc in Neuroscience, Certified Death/End of Life Doula through Quality of Life CareDoulaR(make this the superscript R with a circle around it) program (add link to: https://www.certifiedcaredoula.com)</p>\n    </div>\n    \n  </div>\n  <div class=\"contact\">\n    <p>Service area: Northeast New England (based in Portsmouth, New Hampshire)</p>\n    <p>Fee schedule: sliding scale available</p>\n    <p>Contact information: sjcdoula@gmail.com 603-566-7969</p>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"role\"></div>\n  <footer>\n    <h6>\"We're all just walking each other home.\" -Ram Das\n    </h6>\n  </footer>\n\n</body>\n</html>"},"sourceMaps":null,"error":null,"hash":"7e945024e9b33c177f8d55b93bbdf47d","cacheData":{}}
